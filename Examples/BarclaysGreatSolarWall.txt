The great solar wall

FSLR's moat is getting wider with more restrictive regulatory
policy against the competition. It will be difficult for projects
slated to go into service in 2030 to qualify for the ITC without
a FSLR panel and we think this gives the company leverage to
book up 2028 and 2029 as well.

Bullish datapoints from the call: 1) Bookings totaling 2.1 GW with implied ASP of $0.32-0.33/w.
Although this includes the impact of a cancellation payment, we think it's still a positive
indicator for where pricing is trending, especially since the bulk of this booking was for
Southeast Asia Series 6 panels. Domestic modules typically have gone for about a 5 cent
premium to the SE product while S7 product also sells for a premium to S6. Pricing power for
FSLR also likely increases for deliveries beyond 2026; 2) Bookings of 2 GW in July alone, mostly
for deliveries next year, but positions FSLR to book up the open capacity left remaining through
2030, especially as a FSLR panel is necessary for safe-harbored projects that are slated to go into
service in 2030; 3) AD/CVD, Section 232, and increased UFLPA enforcement only increases the
uncertainty around pricing and availability of future Chinese panels for the projects that are
being safe harbored by YE25 (as FEOC doesn't apply through 12/31/25) if the customer is only
purchasing 5% today and taking delivery of the remaining equipment needs at a later time.

Bookings for the quarter are strong with respect to volume and price: FSLR reported 2.1GW
of bookings in the month of July, a threshold it hasn't crossed since 1Q24, and noted an
increase in activity following the enactment of OBBB. The implied ASP was $0.32-0.33/w. While
implied ASPs of prior quarters have been in the ~$0.30-0.31/w range, we would note that the
number is usually a blend of US (which sells for a higher ASP) and SE Asia supply (which sells for
a lower ASP). From what we gather, the 2 GW is mostly SE Asia Series 6 panels and while it
includes the cancellation payment from a de-booking that got re-booked, we still think it's a
positive indicator for where pricing is trending, especially if we factor in that domestically
produced panels go for a ~$0.04-$0.05/w premium to the SE Asian manufactured products. A
large portion of the 2.1 GW was from a single customer, trying to fill in for a canceled delivery
from a Chinese manufacturer needed for 2026. This customer does present them with the
opportunity for much larger follow-on bookings in the future and it was notable that this was a
customer that FSLR hasn't sold to in several years. A smaller amount of the bookings was
related to safe harboring to lock in tax credits prior to the release of updated Treasury guidance.
It would appear that this customer booked the amount needed to qualify under the 5% rule and
if that's the case, we would expect this customer to come back to book the remaining supply,

 

which would be a much bigger size, needed for the project at a later time.

Moat gets wider and we think there is line of sight for FSLR to get fully booked through
2030: For developers that are planning to safe harbor projects to place in service in 2030, it's

important to note that those projects will need FSLR modules (or at least a domestically
manufactured cell) in order to qualify for the ITC. These projects would have to be safe harbored
on or after 1/1/26 but before 7/4/26 and during that timeframe, FEOC restrictions will

apply. This gives FSLR some leverage, in our view. Deliveries for 2030 will be in high demand due
to this nuance and we would expect FSLR to use this as leverage to have customers also take
deliveries in earlier years, such as 2028 and 2029. We would point out that FSLR did something
similar in past year, except the timing was reverse - customers needed FSLR panels more
immediately and agreed to also take on more supply in future years where there was still some
available capacity that the company was looking to book. Even beyond this dynamic, we would
note that the policy backdrop that is increasingly becoming more restrictive provides additional
tailwinds as the pending Section 232 investigation, the likelihood of additional AD/CVD tariffs on
India/Laos/Indonesia, and rising UFLPA enforcement will all increase the price and decrease the
availability of alternative panel supply.

Higher than expected tariffs make the buildout of finishing capacity highly likely at this
point, possibly as early as mid-2026: With tariffs for India, Malaysia and Thailand in the 20%+
range rather than something in the 10% range, we expect the company to build finishing
capacity in the US. This would accomplish 3 things: 1) lower the tariffs paid by 2/3rd as the
declared value for the semi-finished good would be something in the teens rather than
$0.30/w+ for a completed module; 2) enable FSLR to collect $0.07/w of 45X credit, which should
also help economics, and 3) produce a product with some domestic content. FSLR would be
able to move some of the equipment for these processes from SE Asia fairly quickly and we
think it can be up and running by mid-2026. We also think the company would elect to do this
for their India production as well, but it would take longer.

Topline increases for the guide, the bottom line range narrows: FY25 sales was raised from
$4.5bn-$5.5bn to $4.9bn-$5.7bn (a midpoint rise of $300mm), as recent policy and trade
developments have lifted the bottom end of FSLR's volume sold forecast to 16.7GW from
15.5GW (the top remains the same at 19.3GW). The gross margin forecast, while narrower in
range, kept the midpoint steady at ~$2.2bn (from $1.96bn-$2.47bn to $2.05bn-$2.35bn). This
represents a drop in FY gross margin of about 3% at midpoint, from ~44% to ~41%, mostly
attributable to the updated tariffs. FSLR's operating expense forecast increased
commensurately with the increase in sales estimates, leading to an operating income projection
with narrower ranges but a similar ~$1.7bn midpoint (from $1.45bn-$2bn to $1.53bn-$1.87bn).
EPS estimates also narrowed from $12.5-$17.5 to $13.5-$16.5, with $15 midpoint remaining
unchanged. The net cash balance expectations increased significantly, from $0.4bn-$0.9bn to
$1.3bn-$2bn, as the previous guidance did not include any monetization of 45X tax credits.
Looking to 3Q, FSLR expects to be able to sell between 5GW and 6GW of modules, including the
2.1GW in July.

FSLR beats the quarter from top to bottom: FSLR reported 2Q revenue of $1.1bn, which
topped consensus/BARC at $1.04bn/51.03bn, as they were able to sell 3.6GW of modules in the
quarter (vs. the guide of 3.0GW-3.9GW). Gross margin for the quarter came in at $500mm, or
45%, higher than Street/BARC of 41%/41%. This margin beat led operating income to

$361mm, measurably above consensus and our model, at $297mm and $292mm, respectively.
Adjusted diluted EPS was posted at $3.18, again beating out Street/BARC at $2.66/$2.78. FSLR
reported a 2Q cash balance of $1.12bn, just behind BARC at $1.13bn, and meaningfully ahead of
consensus at $946mm, as the company sold $312mm worth of Section 45X credits for proceeds
of $296mm. FSLR recently announced another $391mm sale of 45X credits, which will be paid in
three installments over the course of 2025.

Price Target: Our unchanged price target of $216 is based on $80 of 45X credits (unchanged)
tied to the wafer, cell, and module, and a ~10x P/E multiple (unchanged) on our 2027E EPS of

$13.57 (ex tax credits) (vs. $13.58 prior).

OVERWEIGHT

Price (31-Jul-2025) USD 174.73
Price Target USD 216.00

Why OVERWEIGHT?
Short/intermediate-term demand
for domestically sourced modules
remains strong, driven by customer
demand for products that will
enable them to benefit from the
10% domestic content adder. This
has enabled revenue visibility
through 2025 and stable/slightly
increasing ASPs, along with
increasing gross margins.

Upside case USD 269.00
We assume an 14x P/E multiple on
our 2027 EPS estimate, plus an
additional $80 from potential

manufacturing credits.

Downside case USD 120.00
We assume a 3x P/E multiple on our
2027 EPS estimate, plus an
additional $80 from potential

manufacturing credits.
